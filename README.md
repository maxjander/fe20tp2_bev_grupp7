## Description
A group project built around "big-data" representation through APIs 
using ReactJS, Firebase Realtime Database,
and the YGOPRODECK API.
The webpage works as a portfolio tracker, where you can add your own Yugioh! cards to your account's portfolio, and track the value of each card,
as well as your overall inventory over time.
